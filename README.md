#### BlackJack is under development and not meant to be used; aside from those curious & daring few. :)

BlackJack strives to be a full featured crate for general data processing.


_Long term_ goal is to create a lightweight [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) equivalent
by and for the Rust community, but with slight differences in focus...


The project strives for a few key principles. When any implementation decisions are to be made,
they are made with these principles in mind, and in this order:
1. **Memory efficiency**
    - Minimize memory use at every opportunity.
2. **Usability**
    - Strive for ergonomics; often done by modeling the `Pandas` API where possible.
3. **Speedy**
    - It comes naturally most times with Rust. :)


Eventually we'll have a Python wrapper: [Lumber-Jack](https://github.com/milesgranger/lumber-jack)
associated with this crate, but that time will come.

### Example use:

```rust
use blackjack::prelude::*;

// We have a dataframe, of course...
let mut df = DataFrame::new();

// Make some series, of different types
let series_i32: Series<i32> = Series::arange(0, 5);
let mut series_f64: Series<f64> = Series::from_vec(vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]);

// You can set a series name!
series_f64.set_name("my-series");

// Or not... 
assert_eq!(series_i32.name(), None);

// And add them to the dataframe
df.add_column(series_f64).unwrap();
df.add_column(series_i32).unwrap();

// And then get a reference to a Series
let series_f64_ref: &Series<f64> = df.get_column("my-series").unwrap();

// and a lot more...
```
